# archivebooks
hello. this is my archive of books.  well, i don't know why i spent time piecing this together if no one is gonna thank me. maybe it is just the Sunday morning loneliness, or maybe i just wanted to take a look at these books, after many years...  anyway. look at every one of these books, they might interest you.
